Machine Learning:

- Supervised Learning:
	- Regression problems: continuous values with aim at predicting where it will fall on the graph
	- Classification problems: mostly with discrete values, determining where a value falls in.
	
- Unsupervised Learning:
	- No structured/known clusters. You find the clusters yourself. E.g: finding similar news articles
		on the web, clustering users in a database according to their preferences.
	- Harder to know what exactly you're looking for
